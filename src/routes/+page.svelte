<p>hello i am derpygamer2142 i do the programming and things and stuff it is very cool.</p>

<p>I am a 3d graphics nerd, for more on that and some demos see <a href="/3d">the 3d page</a></p>

<p>If you want to check out my turbowarp extensions go to the <a href="extensions.derpygamer2142.com">extensions page</a></p>

<p>For a list of my finished and in progress stuff check out the <a href="/portfolio">portfolio page</a></p>

<p>There might also be a blog here at some point depends on if i think it would be cool</p>

<h3>stuff about me</h3>

<p style="max-width: 50vw; position: relative; left: 25vw;">i like the 3d and gpu go brrrrrrr. 
    i work with scratch a lot, usually turbowarp because it's faster and supports extensions. i
     think c is cooler than rust but i use javascript most of the time cuz it's easy and for some reason c doesn't like compiling on my pc all the time. 
     i am an expert at putting in a ton of effort into things but making it look really bad and low quality(it's intentional i swear)
</p>

<h3>WIP Projects</h3>

<ul>
    <p>Microsoft 3D Movie Maker in Scratch - Pretty much what it sounds like. Still learning enough about 3D graphics to make this.</p>
    <p>Turbowarp WebGPU extension - compute shaders and stuff in Turbowarp cuz pen+/webgl doesn't have that, it has a custom compiler and it's almost done. it's pretty cool</p>
</ul>

<h3>Projects I Haven't Started Yet But am Totally Going to Soonâ„¢ I Just Need To Finish one Last Thing</h3>

<ul>
    <p>Platformer Shooter Thing - Idk how to explain this man</p>
    <p>Meower clone - Meower gonna die so i wanna make my own version that was planned for meower but we never got around to doing it</p>
    <p>Scratch but Text Based and Cooler - Scratch's project sharing but with a cool text based editor and simplicity</p>
    <p>Skibidi toilet rendered in Scratch - still thinking about what this means i thought it would be funny tho</p>
</ul>
